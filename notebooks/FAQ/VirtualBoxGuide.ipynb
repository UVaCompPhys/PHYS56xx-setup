    "It's relatively easy to install a virtual machine these days and run any number of operating systems on a single machine. This can be a relatively heavy weight solution in terms of memory requirements and disk space if you system does not have many extra resources. But most modern laptops should be be able to host a modest VM. This guide describes how to use VirtualBox to set up a Ubuntu LINUX distribution with the MATE desktop \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download a LINUX VM here: https://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox-images/\n",
    "    * Note: many VM images are provided here, but some variant of Ubuntu is a good choice for beginners.\n",
    "    * For example, here we will use the Ubuntu-Mate image, which wil give you a desktop very similar to Rivanna.\n",
    "    * Make sure you select the VirtualBox (VDI) image.\n",
    "    * After downloading, extract the image from the 7z file.  Then you'll have a directory with a name like __U_M1910-VB-64bit__ containing the VDI image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download and Install the VirtualBox [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) for your OS to manage your virtual machine.  You should reboot your machine after installing VirtualBox."

    "_The size of your virtual disk will initally be ~7 GB.  This is disk is dynamically sized and will expand as you add files to your VM.  Unfortunately, it won't shrink automatically.  So if you cach a few seasons of your favorite Nexflix show on the VM, its disk file will get pretty large and stay that way. You can delete files and shrink the virtual disk using a combination of tools in Ubuntu and VirtualBox, but that shouldn't be necessary if you're just using your VM for class._"
